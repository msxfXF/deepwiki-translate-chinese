# Sample Documentation

Welcome to the **DeepWiki** translation demo.

- Keep code blocks unchanged:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

- Preserve links like [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) and images ![Logo](images/logo.png).
- Avoid translating file names such as `data/sample.csv`.
- Maintain tables:

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Chunking | Ready |
| Async | Enabled |

Some longer paragraph to test chunking and formatting. The translation should keep markdown structure intact while converting natural language to Chinese without altering URLs or inline code `const value = 42`.
